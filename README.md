# Ocru Handbook
Ocru stands for Open Canvas Rendering Utility. Ocru is an open source JavaScript library for creating graphics-based applications for the web in an Object-Oriented way. Ocru adds an object oriented framework on top of the JavaScript Canvas API.
Ocru provides:
- An intuitive Object-Oriented layer that lets beginners start working with objects in the Canvas quickly, while still allowing power users to squeeze out every drop of power from the Canvas API.
- Individual components and classes which are useful on their own, and also form a full and capable game development framework when used together.
- A Non-callback User Input API.
- Easy to use collision detection (using SAT).

Ocru is open source, that means people like you help make Ocru possible. If you want to improve or add on to Ocru head over to the github page to start contributing!
